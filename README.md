## Overview

Angle based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) is a
dimensionality reduction algorithm for the multi-block setting i.e.Â $K$
different data matrices, with the same set of observations and
(possibly) different numbers of variables. **AJIVE finds *joint* modes
of variation which are common to all $K$ data blocks as well as modes of
*individual* variation which are specific to each block.** For a
detailed discussion of AJIVE see [Angle-Based Joint and Individual
Variation Explained](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02060.pdf).

A python version of this package can be found
[**here**](https://github.com/idc9/py_jive).

## Installation

The `ajive` package is currently available using devtools:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("idc9/r_jive")
```

## Example

Consider the following two block toy example: the first block has 200
observations (rows) and 100 variables; the second block has the same set
of 200 observations and 500 variables (similar to Figure 2 of the AJIVE
paper).

``` r
library(ajive)

# sample a toy dataset with true joint rank of 1
blocks <- sample_toy_data(n = 200, dx = 100, dy = 500)

data_blocks_heatmap(blocks, show_color_bar = FALSE)
```

After selecting the initial signal ranks we can compute the AJIVE
decomposition using the `ajive` function.

``` r
initial_signal_ranks <- c(2L, 3L) # set by looking at scree plots
jive_results <- ajive(
    blocks = blocks, 
    initial_signal_ranks = initial_signal_ranks, 
    n_wedin_samples = 100L, 
    n_rand_dir_samples = 100L
)

# estimated joint rank
jive_results$joint_rank
#> [1] 1
```

The heatmap below shows that AJIVE separates the joint and individual
signals for this toy data set.

``` r
decomposition_heatmaps(blocks, jive_results)
```

Using notation from Section 3 of the [AJIVE
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02060.pdf) (where *u* means scores and
*v* means loadings) we can get the jive data out as follows:

``` r
# common normalized scores
dim(jive_results$joint_scores)
#> [1] 200   1

# Full matrix representation of the joint signal for the first block
dim(jive_results$block_decomps[[1]][['joint']][['full']])
#> [1] 200 100

# joint block specific scores for the first block
dim(jive_results$block_decomps[[1]][['joint']][['u']])
#> [1] 200   1

# joint block specific loadings for the first block
dim(jive_results$block_decomps[[1]][['joint']][['v']])
#> [1] 100   1

# individual block specific scores for the second block
dim(jive_results$block_decomps[[2]][['individual']][['u']])
#> [1] 200   2
```
